TODO

 - Use a canvas in order to draw an image on the console, using the bg
as pixels. (a canvas allows us to rotate and scale the image, as well as
apply other effects to it)
 - Get loveterm.wrapString to be able to use two colored text
 - Add justified and centered text
 - Add printf as a combination of print and wrapString
