The files CGA8x8thick.png, CGA8x8thin.png, and MDA9x14.png were ripped from IBM computers by Lord Nightmare/IBM of dwarffortresswiki.org and I really appreciate their work. :)
NOTE: As far as I can find out, bitmap fonts are not copyrightable in the United States. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property_protection_of_typefaces for some more information)
